Immediate Previous Larger Number (Id-3143)

N numbers are passed as input to the program. The program must print the immediate previous larger number. If there is no such larger 
number print 0 for that specific number.

Note: As N can be as high as 100000, optimize your algorithm to avoid timeout.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N numbers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains N numbers which denote the immediate previous larger number.

Boundary Conditions:
2 <= N <= 100000

Example Input/Output 1:

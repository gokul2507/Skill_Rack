Find Time - Normal & Slow Clocks
There are clocks C1 and C2 hanging on a wall. Initially, both clocks show the same time T (HH:MM:SS). The clock C1 runs normally, while 
clock C2 is slow. The second handle of the C2 clock moves 1 unit every K seconds. The program must accept the time T and the value of 
K as the input. The program must print the times on the two clocks after X seconds as the output. The value of X is also passed the 
input.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= K <= 60
1 <= X <= 10^9

Input Format:
The first line contains the time T (in the format HH:MM:SS).
The second line contains K and X separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the time in the clock C1 after X seconds.
The second line contains the time in the clock C2 after X seconds.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10:05:15
2 60

Output:
10:06:15
10:05:45

Explanation:
Here T = 10:05:15 and X = 60 seconds.
Initially, both clocks C1 and C2 show 10:05:15.
After 60 seconds, the times on the two clocks are 10:06:15 and 10:05:45.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
12:25:10
4 31

Output:
12:25:41
12:25:17

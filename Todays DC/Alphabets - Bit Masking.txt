Alphabets - Bit Masking
The program must accept a string S containing only lower case alphabets as the input. The program must generate an integer X whose 
binary representation indicates the presence of unique alphabets in S. The 26 lower case alphabets (a-z) are mapped to 26 bits in 
the binary representation of X from LSB(least significant bit) to MSB(most significant bit). The presence of the alphabets must
be indicated by the set bits in the binary representation of X. Finally, the program must print the value of X as the output. Please 
fill in the blanks with code so that the program runs successfully.

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value X.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack

Output:
396549

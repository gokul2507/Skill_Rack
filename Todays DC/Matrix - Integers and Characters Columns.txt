Matrix - Integers and Characters Columns
The program must accept a matrix of size R*C as the input. Each column of the matrix contains only integers or characters. The program 
must print the output based on the following conditions.
- For each column with integers, the program must print the sum of the integers in that column.
- Then for each column with characters, the program must print the characters from bottom to top in that column.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Each integer value in the matrix <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain the matrix.

Output Format:
The first line contains the integer values and the string values based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 5
a 10 r e 8
b 20 a n 7
c 30 c o 6
d 40 k n 50

Output:
100 71 dcba kcar none

Explanation:
Here R = 4, C = 5 and the matrix is given below.
a 10 r e 8
b 20 a n 7
c 30 c o 6
d 40 k n 50
1st column: Characters from bottom to top -> dcba
2nd column: Sum of integers -> 100
3rd column: Characters from bottom to top -> kcar
4th column: Characters from bottom to top -> none
5th column: Sum of integers -> 71
Hence the output is
100 71 dcba kcar none

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 3
10 12 20
30 14 60
40 16 80

Output:
80 42 160

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4 4
q p N R
q C U n
m u V C
r N P c

Output:
rmqq NuCp PVUN cCnR

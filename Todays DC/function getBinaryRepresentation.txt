function getBinaryRepresentation
The function/method getBinaryRepresentation accepts an argument N representing a positive integer value.

The function/method getBinaryRepresentation must return the binary representation of N as a doubly linked list (i.e., the function must 
return the head of the resulting doubly linked list).

Your task is to implement the function getBinaryRepresentation so that it passes all the test cases.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

The following structure is used to represent the Node and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in 
your code).
struct Node
{
    int val;
    struct Node *prev, *next;
};
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10

Output:
DLL: 1 0 1 0
Reverse DLL: 0 1 0 1

Explanation:
Here N = 10.
The binary representation of 10 is 1010.
The doubly linked list contains 1 0 1 0.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
25

Output:
DLL: 1 1 0 0 1
Reverse DLL: 1 0 0 1 1

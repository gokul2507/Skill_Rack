function deleteAtMiddle
The function/method deleteAtMiddle accepts an argument head. The head is a pointer to the head of a circular doubly linked list(CDLL).

The function/method deleteAtMiddle must delete the middle node from the given circular doubly linked list and return the revised head. 
If the circular doubly linked list contains only one node, then the function must delete the node and return NULL.

Your task is to implement the function deleteAtMiddle so that it passes all the test cases.

Note: The number of nodes in the given CDLL is always odd.

The following structure is used to represent the Node and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in 
your code).

struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node *prev, *next;
};
IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
12 56 89 40 74

Output:
CDLL:
12 56 40 74
74 40 56 12

Explanation:
After deleting the middle node of the given CDLL, the CDLL becomes 12 56 40 74.
Hence the output is
CDLL:
12 56 40 74
74 40 56 12

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
69 50 7 30 16 49 25

Output:
CDLL:
69 50 7 16 49 25
25 49 16 7 50 69

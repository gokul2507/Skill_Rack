Ascending or Descending or Equal
The program must accept an integer array of size N as the input. The integers in the given array are always sorted. The program must 
print the output based on the following conditions.
- If the given array is sorted in ascending order, then print "Ascending".
- If the given array is sorted in descending order, then print "Descending".
- If all the values in the given array are equal, then print "Equal".

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains a string value based the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 10 20 25 39

Output:
Ascending

Explanation:
Here N = 5.
The given 5 integers are sorted in ascending order. So Ascending is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
99 99 99 70 10 10

Output:
Descending

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
50 50 50 50

Output:
Equal

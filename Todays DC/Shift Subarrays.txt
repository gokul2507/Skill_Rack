Shift Subarrays

The program must accept an integer array of size N and Q queries as the input. Each query contains two integers X, Y and a character 
(L or R). The integers X and Y denote the starting and ending position of a subarray. For each query, the program must modify the array 
by shifting integers in the specified subarray to the left or right by 1 position based on the specified character(L denotes the left 
shift, R denotes the right shift). After processing each query, the program must print the modified array.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= X < Y <= N

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains Q.
The next Q lines, each contains two integers and a character separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first Q lines, each contains N integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
1 2 3 4 5 10 9 8 7 6
3
7 10 L
3 8 R
2 4 R

Output:
1 2 3 4 5 10 8 7 6 9
1 2 7 3 4 5 10 8 6 9
1 3 2 7 4 5 10 8 6 9

Explanation:
Here N = 10 and Q = 3.
Query 1: The value of X is 7, the value of Y is 10 and the given character is L. So the integers in the subarray are shifted to the left 
by 1 position.

Now the array becomes 1 2 3 4 5 10 8 7 6 9.
Query 2: The value of X is 3, the value of Y is 8 and the given character is R. So the integers in the subarray are shifted to the right 
by 1 position.

Now the array becomes 1 2 7 3 4 5 10 8 6 9.
Query 3: The value of X is 2, the value of Y is 4 and the given character is R. So the integers in the subarray are shifted to the right 
by 1 position.

Now the array becomes 1 3 2 7 4 5 10 8 6 9.
Hence the output is
1 2 3 4 5 10 8 7 6 9
1 2 7 3 4 5 10 8 6 9
1 3 2 7 4 5 10 8 6 9

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9
25 36 6 18 15 51 95 78 90
4
1 3 L
2 8 R
6 9 R
1 9 L

Output:
36 6 25 18 15 51 95 78 90
36 78 6 25 18 15 51 95 90
36 78 6 25 18 90 15 51 95
78 6 25 18 90 15 51 95 36

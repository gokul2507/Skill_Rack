Define class Distance
The program must accept two distances(in feet and inches) as the input. The program must print the sum of the two distances(in feet 
and inches) as the output. Then the program must add X inches to the sum and print the revised distance. The value of X is also passed 
as the input.

Yout task is to define the class Distance that the program runs successfully.

The calling code Hello.py is as given below.
from distance import Distance

feet, inches = map(int, input().split())
dist1 = Distance(feet, inches)
feet, inches = map(int, input().split())
dist2 = Distance(feet, inches)
X = int(input())
dist3 = dist1 + dist2
print(dist3)
dist3.addInches(X)
print(dist3)

Formula: 1 Foot = 12 Inches

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 11
2 10
5

Output:
7 9
8 2

Explanation:
Distance 1 = 4 feet and 11 inches.
Distance 2 = 2 feet and 10 inches.
The sum of the two distances is 7 feet and 9 inches.
After adding 5 inches to the sum, the distance becomes 8 feet and 2 inches.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 6
3 6
30

Output:
7 0
9 6

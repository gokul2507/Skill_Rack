Search String - Matrix Edges
The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and a string S as the input. The program must search the string S in 
the four edges (Top, Right, Bottom and Left) of the matrix. Then the program must print a string value representing the edge 
which contains the string S in any order (forward or reverse). If the string S is present in two or more edges, then the program 
must print the first occurring edge in the above mentioned order. If the string S is not present in all four edges, then the program 
must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Length of S <= Minimum value between R and C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains a string value or -1 based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 7
q u b f y a a
j j l a v i c
p z r a p i t
h a u g v x i
c l v t o c v
k o z l o u e
active

Output:
Right

Explanation:
Here S = "active".
The string S is present in the Right edge of the given matrix (from top to bottom).
So Right is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 8
l l a B v r l v
o o j a y i z j
L z r w o q q b
L d c z f d z y
A j c y q r v j
B u y g y l m b
j j f p y i j a
w l n j l n o l
a h g r u s q l
B a l l w r x q
Ball

Output:
Top

Explanation:
Here S = "Ball".
The string S is present in the Top edge (from right to left) and in the Bottom edge (from left to right) of the given matrix.
So the first occurring edge Top is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
5 5
y V w L a
Y T R q b
k C Y v S
S p y B j
g j a a Y
SKY

Output:
-1

Submatrix - Four Same Corners
The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The program must find the first occurring K*K 
submatrix where the four corner elements are the same. Then the program must replace the top-left to bottom-right diagonal and the
top-right to bottom-left diagonal elements of the submatrix with the asterisks. Finally, the program must print the modified character
matrix as the output.
Note: In the given matrix, at least one K*K submatrix always has the same element in all four corners.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= R, C <= 50
2 <= K <= Minimum value between R and C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains K.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7 6
a d z d o t
t g y e g b
y d c d i c
s y x v a l
b g s f g f
u a c r p c
k v z n i h
4

Output:
a d z d o t
t * y e * b
y d * * i c
s y * * a l
b * s f * f
u a c r p c
k v z n i h

Explanation:
Here K = 4.
The 4*4 submatrix with the same element in all four corners is highlighted below.
a d z d o t
t g y e g b
y d c d i c
s y x v a l
b g s f g f
u a c r p c
k v z n i h
After replacing the elements in the top-left to bottom-right and the top-right to bottom-left diagonals with the asterisks, the matrix becomes
a d z d o t
t * y e * b
y d * * i c
s y * * a l
b * s f * f
u a c r p c
k v z n i h

Output:
z n * X z G *
x X a * t * E
O n T f * V e
S K G * c * F
z U * r R O *

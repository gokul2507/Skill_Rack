String - First and Last Pattern
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the characters of the string S in L lines (where L is the length 
of the string S) based on the following conditions.
- In the 1st line, the first and the last characters of the string S must be printed.
- In the 2nd line, the first two and the last two characters of the string S must be printed in reverse order.
- In the 3rd line, the first three and the last three characters of the string S must be printed in reverse order.
- Similarly, the program must print the remaining lines as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first L lines, each contains the characters of the string S based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
orange

Output:
oe
roeg
aroegn
naroegna
gnaroegnar
egnaroegnaro

Explanation:
Here the length of the string orange is 6. So the pattern contains 6 lines.
o e (1st and 6th characters)
ro eg (first 2 and last 2 characters in reverse order)
aro egn (first 3 and last 3 characters in reverse order)
naro egna (first 4 and last 4 characters in reverse order)
gnaro egnar (first 5 and last 5 characters in reverse order)
egnaro egnaro (first 6 and last 6 characters in reverse order)

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
SKILLRACK

Output:
SK
KSKC
IKSKCA
LIKSKCAR
LLIKSKCARL
RLLIKSKCARLL
ARLLIKSKCARLLI
CARLLIKSKCARLLIK
KCARLLIKSKCARLLIKS

function printAlarmTimings
The function/method printAlarmTimings accepts three arguments - startTime, endTime and X. The startTime and endTime are two string 
values that represent the start time and end time of a factory. For every X minutes from the start time to the end time, the factory 
alarm sounds indicating the time slot for the workers.

The function/method printAlarmTimings must print the alarm timings at the factory.

Note: The start time, the end time and the alarm timings are always in 24-hr format HH:MM.

Your task is to implement the function printAlarmTimings so that it passes all the test cases.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

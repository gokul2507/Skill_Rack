function addSeconds
The function/method addSeconds accepts two arguments - time and X. The integer X represents the number of seconds to be added to the 
given time.

The function/method addSeconds must return a new time by adding X seconds to the given time.

Your task is to implement the function addSeconds so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the Time and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in 
your code).

typedef struct time
{
    int hh, mm, ss;
} Time;

Note: The given time will be in 24-hr format HH:MM:SS.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
02:58:45
15

Output:
Old Time:
02:58:45
New Time:
02:59:00

Explanation:
Here the given time is 02:58:45 and the value of X is 15.
After adding 15 seconds to the given time, the time becomes 02:59:00.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
09:45:00
900

Output:
Old Time:
09:45:00
New Time:
10:00:00

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
23:59:20
124

Output:
Old Time:
23:59:20
New Time:
00:01:24

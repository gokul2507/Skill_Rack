function customToUpper
The function/method customToUpper accepts three arguments - str, fromChar and toChar representing a string value and two lower case 
alphabets respectively.

The function/method customToUpper must modify the string str by converting the lower case alphabets that occur between fromChar and 
toChar in the English alphabet set(both inclusive) to upper case.

Your task is to implement the function customToUpper so that it passes all the test cases.

Note: The fromChar always occurs before the toChar in the English alphabet set.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
SkillRack
h p

Output:
Modified String: SKILLRacK

Explanation:
In the given string S, the lower case alphabets that occur from h to p are k, i, l, l and k.
After converting the above lower case alphabets to upper case, the string becomes SKILLRacK.

Example Input/Output 2:

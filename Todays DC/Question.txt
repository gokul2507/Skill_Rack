String Repeat Pattern
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 as the input. The string S1 contains only alphabets and the string S2 contains only 
nonzero digits. The program must print the output based on the following conditions.
- For each digit D in S2, the program must print the first P alphabets of the first string D times, where P represents the position of 
the digit D in S2.

Note: Both S1 and S2 have the same length.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first L lines(where L is the length of S1) contain the alphabets of S1 based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
asdf
4921

Output:
aaaa
asasasasasasasasas
asdasd
asdf

Explanation:
Here S1 = asdf and S2 = 4921.
a -> a is printed 4 times.
asasasasasasasasas -> as is printed 9 times.
asdasd -> asd is printed 2 times.
asdf -> asdf is printed once.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:

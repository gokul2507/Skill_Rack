Define class Person

The below Java program accepts the name, the weight(in kilograms) and the height(in meters) of a person. Then the program calculates 
the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the person and prints the output as given in the Example Input/Output section. Please define the class 
Person so that the program runs successfully.
Note: The height of the person must be printed with the precision up to 2 decimal places. The BMI of the person must be printed with 
the precision up to 1 decimal place.

Formula: BMI = Weight/(Height*Height)

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Hector
80 1.65

Output:
Name: Hector
Weight: 80 kg
Height: 1.65 m
BMI: 29.4

Explanation:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) of the person is 29.4 (80 / (1.65*1.65)).
Hence the output is
Name: Hector
Weight: 80 kg
Height: 1.65 m
BMI: 29.4

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:

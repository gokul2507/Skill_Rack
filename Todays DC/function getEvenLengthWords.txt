function getEvenLengthWords
The function/method getEvenLengthWords accepts an argument str representing a string value. The string str contains multiple words.

The function/method getEvenLengthWords must return an array of string values representing the even length words in the string str. 
If there is no such word, then the function must return an array of size 1 with the string value "-1".

Your task is to implement the function getEvenLengthWords so that the program runs successfully.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition 
again in your code).

typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    char **words;
} boundedArray;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:

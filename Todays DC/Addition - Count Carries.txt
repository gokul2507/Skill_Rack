Addition - Count Carries
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must print the number of carries generated when adding X and Y 
as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains X.
The second line contains Y.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of carries generated when adding X and Y.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
451
349

Output:
2

Explanation:
Here X=451 and Y=349.
The unit digits 1 and 9 are added. The carry is 1.
Then 1 + the digits in tenth position = 1+5+4 = 10 and hence the carry is 1.
Then 1 + the digits in hundredth position = 1+4+3 = 8 and hence NO carry.
Total number of carries is 2, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
99
190

Output:
1

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
99
7

Output:
2

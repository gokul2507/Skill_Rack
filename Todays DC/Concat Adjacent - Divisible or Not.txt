Concat Adjacent - Divisible or Not
An array of N integers is passed as the input. The program must print a pair of adjacent values if the concatenated value is divisible 
by another integer X. The value of X is also passed as the input to the program. If there is no such pair, the program must print -1 
as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value, X <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines each contains a pair of adjacent values or the first line contains -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
2 4 8 6 5 11
4

Output:
2 4
4 8
6 8
5 6

Explanation:
Here X = 4.
2 and 4 forms 24 which is divisible by 4.
4 and 8 can form 48 or 84 and both are divisible by 4.
8 and 6 form 68 which is divisible by 4.
6 and 5 form 56 which is divisible by 4.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
8 4 14 2 19 130 8 58
12

Output:
8 4
14 4
19 2
130 8
58 8

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
7
9 3 17 3 16 4 19
15

Output:
-1

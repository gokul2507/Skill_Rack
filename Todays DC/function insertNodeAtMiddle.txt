function insertNodeAtMiddle
The function/method insertNodeAtMiddle accepts two arguments - head and data. The head is a pointer to the head of the circular doubly 
linked list(CDLL) and the data represents an integer value to be inserted in the middle of the CDLL.

The function/method insertNodeAtMiddle must insert a node with the given data at the middle of the given CDLL and return the head of 
the revised CDLL.

Your task is to implement the function insertNodeAtMiddle so that it passes all the test cases.

Note: The number of nodes in the given CDLL is always even.

The following structure is used to represent the Node and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in 
your code).

struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node *prev, *next;
};

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
37 91 77 22
50

Output:
CDLL:
37 91 50 77 22
22 77 50 91 37

Explanation:
Here N = 4 and the given 4 integers are 37 91 77 22.
After inserting the node with the data 50 at the middle of the CDLL, the CDLL becomes 37 91 50 77 22.
Hence the output is
CDLL:
37 91 50 77 22
22 77 50 91 37

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
30 15 20 45 80 50
70

Output:
CDLL:
30 15 20 70 45 80 50
50 80 45 70 20 15 30

Substring - First Occurrence
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 as the input. The program must find the positions of the first occurrence of all 
characters of S2 in S1. Then the program must print the characters in S1 from the minimum position to the maximum position among the 
positions obtained.
Note: All characters of S2 always occur at least once in S1.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S1 <= 1000
2 <= Length of S2 <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first line contains the characters in S1 from the minimum position to the maximum position among the positions obtained.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
corporate
oar

Output:
orpora

Explanation:
Here S1 = corporate, S2 = oar.
The position of the first occurrence of o in the string S1 is 2.
The position of the first occurrence of a in the string S1 is 7.
The position of the first occurrence of r in the string S1 is 3.
The characters from the 2nd position (minimum position) to the 7th position (maximum position) in S1 are o r p o r a.
Hence orpora is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
skillrack
lak

Output:
killra

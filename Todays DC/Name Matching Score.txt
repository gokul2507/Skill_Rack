Name Matching Score
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 representing the names of two persons as the input. The program must calculate the 
name matching score based on the following conditions.
- If a character occurs in the same position in both names, then the score increments by 2.
- If a character occurs in both names but in different positions, then the score increments by 1.
- Once a character in a position is used for the calculation, it cannot be considered again. However, if the same character occurs in 
another position, then it can be used.
Finally, the program must print the name matching score for the given two persons as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the name matching score for the given two persons.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
bhuvana
lavanya

Output:
5

Explanation:
There is only one character that occurs in the same position in both names and it is highlighted below.
bhuvana
lavanya

The characters v, a and n occur in both names but in different positions.
So the total score is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
ABBACCD
ABDCCA

Output:
9

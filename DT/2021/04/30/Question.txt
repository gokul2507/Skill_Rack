Sort Columns - Embedded Alphabets
The program must accept a matrix of size R*C as the input. Each element in the matrix represents an integer and it contains a lower case alphabet. The program must sort 
the integer values in the columns based on the alphabets. If two or more elements in a column have the same alphabet, then the program must sort those integers in ascending 
order. Finally, the program must print the sum of integers in each row as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines containing the matrix.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains an integer.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 3
9c7 5s2 p661
690d 7k9 q41
a38 3i75 67p
8b0 90m 5p74

Output:
480
733
848
783

Explanation:
After sorting the integer values in the columns based on the given conditions, the matrix becomes
38 375 67
80 79 574
97 90 661
690 52 41
So the sum of integers in each row of the above matrix is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 4
1h1 r95 h40 35z
i84 c33 56h 2r4
4d2 87p 7h9 s88
10u 59c 23h 71v
82n 9c5 h38 n82

Output:
180
132
307
296
219

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs

Define class BankAccount
The program must accept an integer B representing the balance in a bank account and N integers representing N transactions in the bank 
account as the input. A positive integer indicates that the amount is added to the account(credit). A negative integer indicates that 
the amount is withdrawn from the account(debit). For each transaction, the program must print the output based on the following 
conditions.

Debit: If the amount to be debited is less than or equal to the account balance, then it must be deducted from the balance. Else the 
program must print "Insufficient Balance".

Credit: The program must add the given amount to the balance.

After each transaction, the program must print the balance.

You must define the class BankAccount so that the program runs successfully.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1000
4
-500
-1000
2000
-1000

Output:
500
Insufficient Balance
500
2500
1500

Explanation:
The balance in the bank account is 1000.
1st transaction: 500 debited. Now the balance becomes 500.
2nd transaction: The amount to be debited is 1000, which is greater than the balance. So "Insufficient Balance" is printed. The balance remains the same 500.
3rd transaction: 2000 credited. Now the balance becomes 2500.
4th transaction: 1000 debited. Now the balance becomes 1500.

Unfolded Right Triangular Pyramid

The program must accept 4 characters and an integer N as the input. The 4 characters represent the 4 faces of a right triangular pyramid
 as given below.
4 1 2
* 3 *
The integer N represents the size of each face of the right triangular pyramid. The program must print the 4 faces of the unfolded 
right triangular pyramid as mentioned above. The empty spaces in the unfolded right triangular pyramid must be printed as asterisks.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains 4 characters separated by a space.
The second line contains N.

Output Format:
The first 2*N lines containing the 4 faces of the unfolded right triangular pyramid.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
a b c d
3

Output:
d d d a b b b
*d d a a b b*
**d a a a b**
****c c c****
*****c c*****
******c******

Explanation:
Here N = 3, so the size of each face of the triangular pyramid is 3 (i.e., 3 row in each face).
The character 'a' represents the face 1.
The character 'b' represents the face 2.
The character 'c' represents the face 3.
The character 'd' represents the face 4.
The asterisks in the unfolded right triangular pyramid represent the empty spaces.
Hence the output is
d d d a b b b
*d d a a b b*
**d a a a b**
****c c c****
*****c c*****
******c******

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
W X Y Z

Output:
Z Z Z Z Z Z W X X X X X X
*Z Z Z Z Z W W X X X X X*
**Z Z Z Z W W W X X X X**
***Z Z Z W W W W X X X***
****Z Z W W W W W X X****

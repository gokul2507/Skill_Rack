Parallel String Values - Matrix
The program must accept a character matrix of size N*N and two string values S1, S2 as the input. The program must print YES if both 
S1 and S2 occur parallel in the horizontal or vertical direction (i.e., S1 and S2 occur in two different rows or two different columns 
in any order). Else the program must print NO as the output.
Note: The length of S1 and the length of S2 are always equal.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 25
2 <= Length of S1, S2 <= N

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains N characters separated by a space.
The (N+2)th line contains S1.
The (N+3)th line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
e a d m t
t p i a q
m p z n o
h l d g n
t e v o k
apple
mango

Output:
YES

Explanation:
The string S1 is present in the 2nd column (top to bottom).
The string S2 is present in the 4th column (top to bottom).
So YES is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
w b j c d w b u
e m d m g l o u
j l a i c e p s
y o w v f i f s
b c g j l g v i
p x y l o s v k
s n k k b h z o
c r i c k e t b
cricket
special

Output:
YES

Explanation:
The string S1 is present in the 8th row (left to right).
The string S2 is present in the 3rd row (right to left).
So YES is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
s t m c
f o u r
t u o r
z r e w

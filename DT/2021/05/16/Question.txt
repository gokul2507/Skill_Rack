ProgramID- 10269

Alternate Alphanumeric Rows
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must form an integer matrix M1 of size N*N using the sequence of N*N 
integers from 1 to N*N. Then the program must form a character matrix M2 of size N*N using the sequence of N*N lower case alphabets 
from a to z circularly (i.e., after the alphabet z, the sequence again starts from the alphabet a). The program must print the output 
based on the following conditions.
- If N is odd, then the program must print the 1st row of M1, 2nd row of M2, 3rd row of M1, 4th row of M2, and so on.
- If N is even, then the program must print the 1st row of M2, 2nd row of M1, 3rd row of M2, 4th row of M1, and so on.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first N lines, each contains N values (integers or alphabets) separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3

Output:
1 2 3
d e f
7 8 9

Explanation:
Here N = 3 which is an odd integer.
The 3*3 integer matrix is given below.
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
The 3*3 character matrix is given below.
a b c
d e f
g h i
In the 1st line, the integers 1 2 3 are printed.
In the 2nd line, the alphabets d e f are printed.
In the 3rd line, the integers 7 8 9 are printed.

Separate Alphabets & Integers - Matrix
The program must accept a matrix of size R*C containing alphabets and integers as the input. For each column in the given matrix, the 
program must separate the alphabets and the integers so that the column contains all the alphabets followed by all the integers in the 
order of their occurrence. Finally, the program must print the modified matrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines containing the matrix.

Output Format:
The first R lines containing the modified matrix.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 6
12 45 b 78 15 32
34 n 54 d y p
k 45 60 t 80 90
a 50 g r 15 w

Output:
k n b d y p
a 45 g t 15 w
12 45 54 r 80 32
34 50 60 78 15 90

Explanation:
Here R = 4 and C = 6.
After separating the alphabets and the integers in the columns based on the given conditions, the matrix becomes
k n b d y p
a 45 g t 15 w
12 45 54 r 80 32
34 50 60 78 15 90

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 4
84 a 43 p
26 b 41 q
84 r d r
87 t e 24
20 c f 91

Output:
84 a d p
26 b e q
84 r f r
87 t 43 24
20 c 41 91

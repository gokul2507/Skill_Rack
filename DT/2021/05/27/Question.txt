Boats & Ships - South or East
The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C representing a port as the input. The character asterisk (*) represents water. 
The character hash symbol (#) represents a boat. Two consecutive hash symbols (vertically or horizontally) represent a ship. The 
vertical ships can move only towards the south. The horizontal ships can move only towards the east. The boats can move towards 
south or east. The boats and ships leave the port based on the following conditions.
- Every odd minute, the last occurring boat or the horizontal ship in each row leave the port (towards east).
- Every even minute, the last occurring boat or the vertical ship in each column leave the port (towards south).
- A boat or ship cannot move if there is another boat or ship on its way.
The program must print the number of minutes it takes to empty port as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 25

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the number of minutes it takes to empty port.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 8
* # * # * # * *
# * * # * * * #
* # # * # # * #
# * * * * * # *

Output:
5

Explanation:
After 1 minute (2 boats left the port), the port becomes
* # * # * * * *
# * * # * * * #
* # # * # # * #
# * * * * * * *
After 2 minutes (2 vertical ships and 1 boat left the port), the port becomes
* # * * * * * *
# * * * * * * *
* # # * # # * *
* * * * * * * *
After 3 minutes (1 horizontal ship and 2 boats left the port), the port becomes
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* # # * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
After 4 minutes the port remains the same (no more boats or ships to leave the port).
After 5 minutes (1 horizontal ship left the port), the port becomes empty.
It takes 5 minutes to empty the port. So 5 is printed as the output.

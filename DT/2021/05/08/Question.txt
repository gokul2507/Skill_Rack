Rain Drop Lights Pattern
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C representing the state of rain drop lights and an integer T as the input. Each 
column in the matrix represents a rain drop and it contains the integers from 0 to R-1 representing the brightness of lights. The lights 
in each column change their state after a delay of X seconds (i.e., the brightness of the lights in a column shifted down by a position 
after a delay of X seconds). The delay(in seconds) for each column is passed as the input. The program must print the state of the rain 
drop lights after T seconds as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Delay time for each column <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R, C and T separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains C integer values representing the delay time for C columns.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integers values representing the state of the rain drop lights after T seconds.
 
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 7 4
0 3 2 0 3 2 0
1 4 3 1 4 3 1
2 0 4 2 0 4 2
3 1 0 3 1 0 3
4 2 1 4 2 1 4
2 1 1 3 1 1 2

Output:
3 4 3 4 4 3 3
4 0 4 0 0 4 4
0 1 0 1 1 0 0
1 2 1 2 2 1 1
2 3 2 3 3 2 2

Explanation:
Here T = 4.
1st and 7th columns: Delay = 2 seconds. So the lights in the columns 1 and 7 change their state every 2 seconds.
2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th columns: Delay = 1 second. So the lights in the columns 2, 3, 5 and 6 change their state every second.
4th column: Delay = 3 seconds. So the lights in the column 4 change their state every 3 seconds.
After 4 seconds, the state of the rain drop lights becomes
3 4 3 4 4 3 3
4 0 4 0 0 4 4
0 1 0 1 1 0 0
1 2 1 2 2 1 1
2 3 2 3 3 2 2

Define Class Shape
The below Java program accepts the radius of a circle R and two integers X and Y as the input. The program prints the perimeter of the 
circle which has the radius R as the output. Then the program prints the perimeter of the square which has the side X. Then the program 
prints the perimeter of the rectangle which has the length X and the breadth Y.

Your task is to define the class Shape so that the program runs successfully.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2.5
5 15

Output:
15.71
20
40

Explanation:
Here R = 2.5, X = 5 and Y = 15.
Perimeter of the circle = 2 * (22/7) * radius
= 2 * (22/7) * 2.5
= 15.71 (perimeter of the circle is printed with the precision up to 2 decimal places)
Perimeter of the square = 4 * side
= 4 * 5
= 20
Perimeter of the rectangle = 2 * (length + breadth)
= 2 * (5 + 15)
= 40

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3.25
7 12

Output:
20.43
28
38

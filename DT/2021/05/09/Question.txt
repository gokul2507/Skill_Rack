ProgramID- 12577
 
Smallest & Largest - Append & Prepend
The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer X among the N integers, the program must find the smallest digit and 
the largest digit in X. Then the program must append(inserting at the end) the smallest digit to X and prepend(inserting at the 
beginning) the largest digit to X. Finally, the program must print the sum of the N modified integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the N modified integers.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
1234 405 12088 15

Output:
8592422

Explanation:
Here N = 4.
1st integer 1234 -> 412341
2nd integer 405 -> 54050
3rd integer 12088 -> 8120880
4th integer 15 -> 5151
The sum of the 4 modified values is 8592422.
So 8592422 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
1 1000 999

Output:
210110

Explanation:
Here N = 3.
1st integer 1 -> 111
2nd integer 1000 -> 110000
3rd integer 999 -> 99999
The sum of the 3 modified values is 210110, which is printed as the output.

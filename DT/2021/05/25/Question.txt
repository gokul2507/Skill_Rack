String Count - Sequence of Alphabets
The program must accept a string S containing only lower case alphabets as the input. The program must print the minimum number of 
string values (of length more than 1) that can be formed using the alphabets where the alphabets are in sequence. If it is not 
possible to form such string values, the program must print -1 as the output. 

Note: The alphabets in S are always distinct.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 26

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
yamobxcnpzr

Output:
3

Explanation:
There are three string values that can be formed using the alphabets where the alphabets are in sequence.
abc, mnop and xyz.
So the count 3 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
acfhkmo

Output:
-1

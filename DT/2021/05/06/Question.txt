N String Values in Columns
The program must accept N string values as the input. The program must print the characters in the given N string values column wise in 
R rows based on the following conditions.
- R represents the length of the first string.
- Each string must start from the first row of a column when printing the characters column wise in R rows (i.e., if all the characters 
in a string are printed column wise, then the characters in the next string start from the first row of the next column).
- The empty spaces must be printed as asterisks (*).

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N, Length of each string <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value.

Output Format:
The first R lines containing the characters in the N string values based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
photos
youtube
facebook

Output:
p y e f o
h o * a k
o u * c *
t t * e *
o u * b *
s b * o *

Explanation:
The length of the first string photos is 6, so the number of rows is R = 6.
In the 1st column, all the characters in the string photos are printed.
In the 2nd column, the first 6 characters in the string youtube are printed.
In the 3rd column, the only remaining character in the string youtube is printed. The empty spaces in 3rd column are printed as asterisks.
In the 4th column, the first 6 characters in the string facebook are printed.
In the 5th column, the remaining 2 characters in the string facebook are printed. The empty spaces in 5th column are printed as asterisks.
Hence the output is
p y e f o
h o * a k
o u * c *
t t * e *
o u * b *
s b * o *

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
one
eleven
seventeen
four

Output:
o e v s e e f r
n l e e n e o *
e e n v t n u *

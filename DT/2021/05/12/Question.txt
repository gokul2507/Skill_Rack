Matrix - Horizontal Replacement

The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and a string S as the input. The program must find the first occurring cell X 
which contains the first character of S in the matrix. Then the program must replace the characters from the cell X with the characters 
of the string S horizontally. If it reaches the last row of the matrix when replacing, then it will start replacing the characters from 
the first row of the matrix. Finally, the program must print the modified matrix as the output.
Note: The first character of S always occurs in the given matrix.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Length of S <= R*C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains S.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 5
y m w h y
i m v a i
p l g x v
h p o v o
o c e s g
l s d b p
vegetable

Output:
y m w h y
i m v e g
e t a b l
e p o v o
o c e s g
l s d b p

Explanation:
The first character of the given string vegetable is v.
The first occurrence of the character v in the matrix is (2, 3).
After replacing the characters from the cell (2, 3) with the characters of the string S, the matrix becomes
y m w h y
i m v e g
e t a b l
e p o v o
o c e s g
l s d b p

ProgramID- 13134

Search Sorted Submatrix
The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C containing only lower case alphabets and an integer K as the input. The program
 must print YES if the matrix contains at least one submatrix of size K*K where all the alphabets in the submatrix are in sorted order.
  Else the program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
2 <= K <= Minimum value between R and C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 5
u l y j m
j m d e f
u o i k n
w t p x y
3

Output:
YES

Explanation:
Here K = 3, the 3*3 submatrix having the alphabets in sorted order is highlighted below
u l y j m
j m d e f
u o i k n
w t p x y
Hence the output is YES.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 5
r q u h g
x k w i p
s g n c s
j z b u r
m z v s w
v s y l s
2

Output:
NO

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4 5
u n m v z
m a a a b
q b b e e
a e e k t
3

Output:
YES

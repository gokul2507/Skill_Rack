function findSurroundingSum
The function/method findSurroundingSum accepts five arguments - R, C, matrix, xRow, xCol. R and C represent the size of the integer matrix. xRow and xCol represent the position of a cell in the matrix.

The function/method findSurroundingSum must return the sum of the surrounding values of the given cell in the matrix.

Your task is to implement the function findSurroundingSum so that it passes all the test cases.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 4
6 4 2 7
7 5 7 1
1 4 8 3
9 2 5 6
5

Output:
39 23

Explanation:
Here X = 5, which occurs twice in the given matrix.
(2, 2) and (4, 3)
The surrounding integers of the first occurrence of 5 are highlighted below.
6 4 2 7
7 5 7 1
1 4 8 3
9 2 5 6
The sum of the surrounding integers of the first occurrence of 5 is 39 (6+4+2+7+7+1+1+4+8).
The surrounding integers of the second occurrence of 5 are highlighted below.
6 4 2 7
7 5 7 1
1 4 8 3
9 2 5 6
The sum of the surrounding integers of the second occurrence of 5 is 23 (4+8+3+2+6).
Hence the output is
39 23

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 5
60 40 40 60 50
10 10 10 10 10
30 20 50 90 20
10

Output:
160 260 320 330 230

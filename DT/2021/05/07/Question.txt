Replace Asterisks within Matrix

The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C as the input. The matrix contains alphabets and asterisks. The program must 
replace the asterisks starting from the first row (left to right in each row) with the alphabets in the original matrix starting from 
the last row (left to right in each row). The number of asterisks in the matrix is always less than or equal to the number of alphabets 
in the given matrix. Finally, the program must print the modified matrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 4
a * r J
g * * b
F V t Y
a V R Q
* * x L

Output:
a x r J
g L a b
F V t Y
a V R Q
V R x L

Explanation:
After replacing the asterisks (from the first row to the last row) with the alphabets (from the last row to the first row), the matrix becomes
a x r J
g L a b
F V t Y
a V R Q
V R x L

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 5
a b * c d
e f * g h
* * * * *
i j k l m
m * n * o
p * * * q

Output:
a b p c d
e f q g h
m n o i j
i j k l m
m k n l o
p m e f q

ProgramID- 13857

Digits - Custom Sorting
The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 containing only digits as the input. The string S2 contains exactly 10 unique 
digits. The program must sort the digits in S1 based on the order of 10 digits in S2. Then the program must print the revised string 
S1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1 <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised string S1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1358719
0219487563

Output:
1198753

Explanation:
S1 = 1358719 and S2 = 0219487563.
After sorting the digits in S1 based on the order of 10 digits in S2, the string S1 becomes 1198753.
So 1198753 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
220196034808762
6732501984

Output:
667322200019884

Replace Duplicates with Next Value
The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets and digits as the input. The program must modify the string S based on the 
following conditions.
- The program must replace each duplicate character from left to right in the string with the next possible value such that there is no 
duplicate character till that character.
- All 26 English alphabets must be considered in a circular fashion(a, b, c, ... x, y, z, a, b, ...) by ignoring the case.
- All 10 digits must be considered in a circular fashion(0, 1, 2, ... 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, ...).
Finally, the program must print the revised string S as the output.

Note:
- The number of alphabets in the string is always less than or equal to 26.
- The number of digits in the string is always less than or equal to 10.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 36

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Twenty5667

Output:
Twenuy5678

Explanation:
Here the given string is Twenty5667.
The character 't' is a duplicate value (ignoring the case), so it is replaced with the next possible value 'u'.
The character '6' (2nd occurrence) is a duplicate value, so it is replaced with the next possible value '7'.
The character '7' is a duplicate value, so it is replaced with the next possible value '8'.
After replacing all the duplicate characters, the revised string becomes Twenuy5678.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
cHesS8880007

Output:
cHesT8901237

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:

Shift Last X Bits
The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must find the 32-bit binary representation of N. Then the program 
must shift the last X bits to the right by 1 position in the binary representation of N. Finally, the program must print the revised 
value of N as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N < 2^32
1 <= X <= 32

Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised value of N.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
75 6

Output:
101

Explanation:
Here N = 75 and X = 6.
The 32-bit binary representation of 75 is 00000000000000000000000001001011.
After shifting the last 6 bits to the right by 1 position, the binary representation becomes
00000000000000000000000001100101
So the revised value of N is 101.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1 32

Output:
2147483648

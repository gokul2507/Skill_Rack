Largest Common Submatrix - Bottom Right
The program must accept two matrices A and B as the input. The size of the matrix A is M*N and the size of the matrix B is R*C. The 
program must print the largest common square submatrix present at the bottom-right of the given two matrices. If there is no common 
submatrix, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= M, N, R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains M and N separated by a space.
The next M lines contain the matrix A.
The (M+2)th line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain the matrix B.

Output Format:
The lines contain the largest common square submatrix at the bottom-right of the given two matrices or the first line contains -1.

Matrix - Count Empty Cells
The program must accept two integers R, C and Q queries as the input. Each query contains two integers X and Y. The program must form a 
matrix of size R*C. For each query, the program must fill 1s in the Xth row and Yth column of the matrix. After each query, the program 
must print the number of empty cells in the matrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Q <= 50
1 <= X <= R
1 <= Y <= C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The second line contains Q.
The next Q lines, each contains two integer values X and Y separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first Q lines, each contains an integer representing the number of empty cells in the matrix.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 5
3
3 2
4 4
3 5

Output:
16
9
6

Explanation:
Here R = 5 and C = 5. So the size of the matrix is 5*5.
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
Each 0 represents an empty cell.

After the 1st query (3, 2), the number of empty cells in the matrix is 16.
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0

After the 2nd query (4, 4), the number of empty cells in the matrix is 9.
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 0

After the 3rd query (3, 5), the number of empty cells in the matrix is 6.
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 5

1 1
3 4
1 2
2 5
3 1

Output:
12

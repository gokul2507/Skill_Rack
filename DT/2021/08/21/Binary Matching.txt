ProgramID- 14012

Binary Matching
The program must accept an integer X and N integers as the input. The given N integer values are always less than or equal to X. The 
program must print the number of integers whose binary representations match the binary representation of X from the LSB(least 
significant bit).

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= X < 2^31

Input Format:
The first line contains X and N separated by a space.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the number of integers whose binary representations match the binary representation of X from the LSB.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
105 5
41 10 9 13 1

Output:
3

Explanation:
Here X = 105.
The binary representation of 105 = 1101001.
The binary representation of 41 is 101001, which matches the binary representation of X from the LSB.
The binary representation of 10 is 1010, which does not match the binary representation of X from the LSB.
The binary representation of 9 is 1001, which matches the binary representation of X from the LSB.
The binary representation of 13 is 1101, which does not match the binary representation of X from the LSB.
The binary representation of 1 is 1, which matches the binary representation of X from the LSB.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
180 6
129 20 52 100 20 4

Output:
4

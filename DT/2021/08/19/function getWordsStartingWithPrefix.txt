function getWordsStartingWithPrefix
The function/method getWordsStartingWithPrefix accepts two arguments str and prefix representing two string values. The string str 
contains multiple words.

The function/method getWordsStartingWithPrefix must return an array of string values representing the words starting with the given 
prefix in the string str. If there is no such word, then the function must return an array of size 1 with the string value "-1".

Your task is to implement the function getWordsStartingWithPrefix so that the program runs successfully.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition 
again in your code).

typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    char **words;
} boundedArray;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

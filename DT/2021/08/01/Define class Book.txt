There are N persons read a book. The total number of pages in the book is X. For each person, the program must accept the two integers 
representing the page numbers(from, to) the person reads. The values of N and X are also passed as the input. The program must print 
the most often read pages in the book in ascending order as the output.

Your task is to define the class Book so that the program runs successfully.

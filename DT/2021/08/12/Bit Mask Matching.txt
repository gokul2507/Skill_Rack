Bit Mask Matching
The program must accept an integer N and a string S containing only upper case alphabets as the input. The binary representation of N 
indicates the status of 26 upper case alphabets based on the following conditions.
- The 26-bits from LSB(least significant bit) to MSB(most significant bit) are mapped to the 26 upper case alphabets(A-Z).
- Each 1 in the binary representation indicates the presence of the corresponding upper case alphabet.
- Each 0 in the binary representation indicates the absence of the corresponding upper case alphabet.
The program must print YES if the string S is formed using only the alphabets indicated by the binary representation of N. Else the 
program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N < 2^26
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
BDBB

Output:
YES

Explanation:
The binary representation of 10 and the alphabet mapping are given below.

The alphabets that can be used to form a string are B and D.
Here the string BDBB is formed using only the alphabets B and D.
So YES is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
44
DECADE

Output:
NO

Explanation:
The binary representation of 44 and the alphabet mapping are given below.
00000000000000000000101100
ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
The alphabets that can be used to form a string are C, D and F.
Here the string DECADE is not formed using only the alphabets C, D and F.
So NO is printed as the output.

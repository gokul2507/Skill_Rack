Merge Video Clips
A video is created by merging N small video clips. The duration(MM:SS) of each video clip is passed as the input. The program must print 
the total duration(HH:MM:SS) of the video created. Then the program must the print the time values at which the N-1 cuts occur in the 
resulting video (i.e., the points where two small video clips are merged).

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains the duration(MM:SS) of a small video clip.

Output Format:
The first line contains the string value "Total Duration: " followed by the total duration(HH:MM:SS) of the video created.
The next N-1 lines contain the time values at which the N-1 cuts occur in the resulting video.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
05:30
25:30
40:15
02:20

Output:
Total Duration: 01:13:35
00:05:30
00:31:00
01:11:15

Explanation:
Here N = 4, the duration of the given 4 video clips are
05:30
25:30
40:15
02:20
The total duration of the video created is 01:13:35. So Total Duration: 01:13:35 is printed.
The time values at which the 3 cuts occur are given below.
00:05:30
00:31:00
01:11:15

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
08:34
03:48
01:57
09:53
05:56
03:40
10:39

Output:
Total Duration: 00:44:27
00:08:34
00:12:22
00:14:19
00:24:12
00:30:08

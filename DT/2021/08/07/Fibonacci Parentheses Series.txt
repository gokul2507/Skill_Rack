Fibonacci Parentheses Series
The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must print the Xth character in the Nth term of the Fibonacci 
parentheses series. The Fibonacci parentheses series given below.
T1 = ()
T2 = ()
T3 = (T2+T1) = (()())
T4 = (T3+T2) = ((()())())
T5 = (T4+T3) = (((()())())(()()))
Similarly, the remaining terms are formed using the sum of the two preceding terms.

Note: The value of X is always less than or equal to the number of characters in the Nth term.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 30

Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the Xth character in the Nth term of the Fibonacci parentheses series.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 6

Output:
)

Explanation:
Here N=4 and X=6.
The 4th term in the fibonacci parentheses series is ((()())()).
The 6th character in the 4th term is ).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 5

Output:
)

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
5 13

Output:
(

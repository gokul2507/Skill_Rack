function writeAdjacencyMatrixToFile
The function/method writeAdjacencyMatrixToFile accepts three arguments - N, E and edges. N is an integer that represents the number of 
nodes in a graph, E is an integer that represents the number of edges in the graph and edges is a 2-D array that represents the E edges
(source and destination) of the graph.

The function/method writeAdjacencyMatrixToFile must write the adjacency matrix to a file called adjacencymatrix.txt using the given 
edges.

Your task is to implement the function writeAdjacencyMatrixToFile so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 7
1 2
3 4
1 3
3 2
3 1
2 4
4 1

Output:
Adjacency Matrix:
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0

Explanation:
Here N = 4 and E = 7.
The graph has 4 nodes and 7 edges.
So the adjacency matrix of the graph is given below.
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0
In the above matrix, the integer 1 indicates that there an edge between the corresponding nodes.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 9
1 2
5 4
4 5
4 1
5 1
1 5
4 3
4 2
2 4

Output:
Adjacency Matrix:
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 0

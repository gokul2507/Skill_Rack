Inverted Triangles in Diagonal Pattern
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print N inverted triangles of asterisks based on the following 
conditions.
- The program must print an inverted triangle of asterisks of size 2 in the first two lines.
- Then the program must print an inverted triangle of asterisks of size 3 in the next 3 lines diagonally.
- Then the program must print an inverted triangle of asterisks of size 4 in the next 4 lines diagonally.
- Similarly, the program must print the remaining triangles diagonally as the output.
- The program must print hyphens instead of empty spaces before each line.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The lines containing the N inverted triangles of asterisks as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4

Output:

Explanation:
Here N = 4, so the output contains 4 inverted triangles of asterisks based on the given conditions.

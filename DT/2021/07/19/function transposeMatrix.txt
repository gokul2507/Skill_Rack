function transposeMatrix
The function/method transposeMatrix accepts an argument fileName representing the name of a file as the input. The given file always 
contains an integer matrix.

The function/method transposeMatrix must modify the content of the file by replacing the matrix with its transpose.

Your task is to implement the function transposeMatrix so that the program runs successfully.

Note: The value of each integer in the matrix is always greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
matrix.txt

Output:
Transpose Matrix:
12 89 30
45 56 40
75 10 50

Explanation:
Here matrix.txt is present in the same folder where the program executes and the file contains the following values.
12 45 75
89 56 10
30 40 50

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
intmatrix.txt

Output:
Transpose Matrix:
1 3 5
2 4 6

Explanation:
Here intmatrix.txt is present in the same folder where the program executes and the file contains the following values.
1 2
3 4
5 6

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs

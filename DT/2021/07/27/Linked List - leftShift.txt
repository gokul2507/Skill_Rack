Linked List - leftShift
The function/method leftShift accepts two arguments head and X. The head is a pointer to the head of a singly linked list and X is an 
integer.

The function/method leftShift must rearrange the singly linked list by shifting the nodes X positions to the left. Then the function 
must return the head of the revised singly linked list.

Your task is to implement the function leftShift so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the Node and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again 
in your code).

struct Node
{
    int val;
    struct Node *next;
};
IMPORTANT:
- Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.
- You must not create any new nodes.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50
2

Output:
Singly Linked List: 30 40 50 10 20

Explanation:
Here N=5, X=2 and the given 5 integers in the list are 10 20 30 40 50.
After shifting the nodes 2 positions to the left, the integers in the list become 30 40 50 10 20.
Hence the output is
Singly Linked List: 30 40 50 10 20

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
12 45 78 56 89 23
59073

Output:
Singly Linked List: 56 89 23 12 45 78

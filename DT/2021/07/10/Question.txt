function readMatrixFromFile
The function/method readMatrixFromFile accepts an argument fileName representing the name of text file. The given text file always 
contains an integer matrix or a character matrix of size R*C.

The function/method readMatrixFromFile must print the output based on the following conditions.
- If the given file contains an integer matrix of size R*C, the program must print the sum of integers in each column of the matrix.
- If the given file contains a character matrix of size R*C, the program must print the odd columns of the matrix.

Your task is to implement the function readMatrixFromFile so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

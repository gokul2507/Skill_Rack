Shop - Add Item or Order Item
The program must accept N queries that represent queries to a shop. Each query contains the query type, the name of an item and the 
quantity. For each query, the program must process the query and print the output based on the following condition.
Query type (+): The program must add the given item to shop along with the quantity.
Query type (-): If the shop can accept the delivery order, then the program must print the string value "Ordered Successfully" and the 
items must be shipped from the shop. Else the program must print the string value "Failed" as the output.

Your task is to define the class Shop so that the program runs successfully.

Input:

+ Pencil 5
+ Pen 4
- Pencil 2
+ NoteBook 3
- Pen 5

Explanation:
Here N = 10.
Query 1: + Pencil 5. So 5 Pencils are added to the shop.
Query 2: + Pen 4. So 4 Pens are added to the shop.
Query 3: - Pencil 2. The shop can accept the delivery order. So Ordered Successfully is printed.
Query 4: + NoteBook 3. So 3 NoteBooks are added to the shop.
Query 5: - Pen 5. The shop cannot accept the delivery order (only 4 Pens in the shop). So Failed is printed.
Query 6: + NoteBook 3. So 3 NoteBooks are added to the shop.
Query 7: - Eraser 2. The shop cannot accept the delivery order (No Erasers in the shop). So Failed is printed.
Query 8: - NoteBook 3. The shop can accept the delivery order. So Ordered Successfully is printed.
Query 9: - NoteBook 1. The shop can accept the delivery order. So Ordered Successfully is printed.
Query 10: + Eraser 10. So 10 Erasers are added to the shop.

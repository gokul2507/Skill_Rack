Two boys A and B play a string alignment game. The boy A gives two string values S1 and S2 to the boy B. The boy B writes the given two 
string values vertically from top to bottom. Then the boy B must move the characters from the second string to the first string 
horizontally only if there are spaces in the first string. And then the boy B must mark the empty spaces with asterisks. The string 
values S1 and S2 are passed as the input to the program. The program must print the string values the boy B wrote as the output.

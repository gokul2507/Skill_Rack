function getWordsStartingWithVowel
The function/method getWordsStartingWithVowel accepts an argument str representing a string value which contains multiple words.

The function/method getWordsStartingWithVowel must return an array of string values representing the words starting with a vowel in the 
given string str. If there is no such word, then the function must return an array of size 1 with the string value "-1".

Your task is to implement the function getWordsStartingWithVowel so that it passes all the test cases.

Note: The length of each word in the given string is always greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition 
again in your code).
typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    char **words;
} boundedArray;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

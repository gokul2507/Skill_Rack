Find Time - Rotate Clock
The program must accept a time T in 12-hr format HH:MM. The program must print the time if the 12 numbers on the clock are rotated by X 
positions in clockwise or anticlockwise direction(the hour handle and the minute handle are always fixed in the clock). The value of X 
is also passed as the input. The positive value of X indicates the clockwise direction and the negative value of X indicates the 
anticlockwise direction.

Note: The value of X is always not equal to 0.

Boundary Condition(s):
-100 <= X <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains a time T.
The second line contains X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised time.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10:25
-4

Output:
02:45

Explanation:
Here the given is 10:25 and the value of X is -4.
After rotating the 12 numbers by 4 positions in anticlockwise direction , the time becomes 02:45.
So 02:45 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10:25
4

Output:
06:05

N String Values - Four Lines
The program must accept N string values of equal length L (where L is always a multiple of 4) as the input. The program must print the 
string values based on the following conditions.
- The number of lines to be printed is 4 * N.
- The number of characters to be printed in each line is (L / 2).
- The program must divide each string into four substrings of equal length.
- The first four lines contain the substrings of 1st and 2nd string values alternatively.
- The next four lines contain the substrings of 3rd and 4th string values alternatively.
- Similarly, the remaining lines are printed as the output.

Note: The value of N is always even.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
4 <= Length of each string <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value.

Output Format:
The first 4 * N lines contain the string values based on the given conditions.

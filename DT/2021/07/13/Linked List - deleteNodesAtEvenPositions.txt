Linked List - deleteNodesAtEvenPositions
The function/method deleteNodesAtEvenPositions accepts an argument head representing a pointer to the head of a singly linked list.

The function/method deleteNodesAtEvenPositions must delete the nodes that occur in the even positions in the given singly linked list 
and then return the revised head of the singly linked list.

Your task is to implement the function deleteNodesAtEvenPositions so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the Node and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again 
in your code).
struct Node
{
    int val;
    struct Node *next;
};

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 20 50 40 30

Output:
Revised Singly Linked List: 10 50 30

Explanation:
After deleting the nodes that occur in the even positions, the list becomes 10 -> 50 -> 30.
Hence the output is
10 50 30

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
13 45 77 89 55 23

Output:
Revised Singly Linked List: 13 77 55

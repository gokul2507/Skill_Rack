Word Expansion
The program must accept a string S containing integers and words alternatively. The number of integers is always equal to the number of 
words in the string S. For each integer X in the string S, the program must print the words that occur after the integer X in the string 
X times as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value in S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The lines containing the string values based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4hi5hello

Output:
hi hello hi hello hi hello hi hello
hello hello hello hello hello

Explanation:
Here the given string is 4hi5hello.
There are 2 integers and 2 words in the given string.
The 1st integer is 4, so the words hi hello are printed 4 times.
The 2nd integer is 5, so the word hello is printed 5 times.
Hence the output is
hi hello hi hello hi hello hi hello
hello hello hello hello hello

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5cat2lion10rat

Output:
cat lion rat cat lion rat cat lion rat cat lion rat cat lion rat
lion rat lion rat
rat rat rat rat rat rat rat rat rat rat

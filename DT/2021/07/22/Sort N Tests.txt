Sort N Tests
N tests are scheduled for the students in a college. The program must accept the name, start time and duration of the N tests as the 
input. The program must sort the tests in chronological order based on the start time. If two or more tests scheduled at the same time, 
then the program must sort those tests in ascending order based on the duration. If two or more tests with the same duration and 
scheduled at the same time, then the program must sort those tests based on their names.

Your task is to define the class Test so that the program runs successfully.

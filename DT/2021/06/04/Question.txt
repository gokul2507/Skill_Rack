function getAverages
The function/method getAverages accepts two arguments SIZE and arr. The integer SIZE represents the size of the integer array arr.

The function/method getAverages must return an array of floating point values containing the average of every three integers in the 
given array arr.

Your task is to implement the function getAverages so that it passes all the test cases.

Note: The size of the given array is always a multiple of 3.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in your code).
typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    double *arr;
} boundedArray;

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
9 8 6 3 4 2

Output:
7.67 3.00

Explanation:
The given 6 integers are 9, 8, 6, 3, 4 and 2.
The average of first three integers 9, 8 and 6 is 7.67.
The average of next three integers 3, 4 and 2 is 3.00.
The average values are printed with the precision up to 2 decimal places.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9
10 33 22 15 46 30 11 42 19

Output:
21.67 30.33 24.00

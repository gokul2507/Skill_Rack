Minimum Moves to Open Lock
In a lock, there are L circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots from 0 to 9. The wheels can rotate freely in clockwise and anticlockwise 
directions. The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 as the input. Both S1 and S2 have the same length L. The string S1 
represents the number in the lock. The string S2 represents the key to open the lock. The program must print the minimum number of 
moves required to open the lock as the output. In one move, only one wheel can be rotated in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= L <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the minimum number of moves required to open the lock.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2850
4007

Output:
12

Explanation:
S1 = 2850
S2 = 4007
The minimum number of moves required to open the lock is 12 (2+2+5+3).
2 -> 4 = 2 (2 -> 3 -> 4)
8 -> 0 = 2 (8 -> 9 -> 0)
5 -> 0 = 5 (5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 0 or 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0)
0 -> 7 = 3 (0 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7)

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
463199
647310

Output:
13

function removeMultiplesOfTen
The function/method removeMultiplesOfTen accepts two arguments - SIZE and arr. The integer SIZE represents the size of the integer 
array arr.

The function/method removeMultiplesOfTen must return an array of integers containing the integers which are not the multiples of 10 in 
the given array. If all the integers in the given array are multiples of 10, then the function must return an array of size 1 with the 
value -1.

Your task is to implement the function removeMultiplesOfTen so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition 
again in your code).
typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    int *arr;
} boundedArray;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
12 40 810 625 120

Output:
Old Array: 12 40 810 625 120
New Array: 12 625

Explanation:
Here N = 5 and the given 5 integers are 12 40 810 625 120.
The integers which are not the multiples of 10 are 12 and 625.
Hence the output is
Old Array: 12 40 810 625 120
New Array: 12 625

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
510 950 90 200

Output:
Old Array: 510 950 90 200
New Array: -1

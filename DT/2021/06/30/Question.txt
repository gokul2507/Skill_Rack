Find Time - N Integers
A boy wants to go to a city as late as possible. He is given N integers and he can choose any two numbers(hour and minute) from the 
given N integers. The N integer values are passed as the input. The program must print the time he needs to start the journey so that 
he will reach the city as late as possible. The time must be printed in 24-hr format HH:MM. If it is not possible to find a time from 
the given N integers, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
0 <= Each integer value <= 59

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the time in 24-hr format HH:MM or -1 based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
30 2 45 13 4

Output:
13:45

Explanation:
Here N = 5 and the 5 integers are 30, 2, 45, 13 and 4.
All the possible times that can be formed using the given 5 integers are given below
02:30
02:45
02:13
02:04
13:30
13:02
13:45
13:04
04:30
04:02
04:45
04:13
The boy starts the journey at 13:45, so he can reach the city as late as possible.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
32 24 59 40

Output:
-1

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
52 0 45 30

Output:
00:52

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs

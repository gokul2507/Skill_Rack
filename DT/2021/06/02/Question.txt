Matrix with Unique Alphabets
The program must accept two lower case alphabets CH1 and CH2 as the input. The program must form a matrix of size 5*5 containing all the 
lower case alphabets except CH1. The 25 lower case alphabets must be filled in the matrix starting from the first row (left to right in 
each row). Then the program must convert the surrounding alphabets of CH2 in the matrix to upper case. Finally, the program must print 
the revised 5*5 matrix as the output.

Input Format:
The first line contains CH1 and CH2 separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first 5 lines contain the revised 5*5 matrix.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
g n

Output:
a b c d e
f H I J k
l M n O p
q R S T u
v w x y z

Explanation:
Here CH1 = 'g' and CH2 = 'n'.
After toggling the surrounding alphabets of n to upper case, the matrix becomes
a b c d e
f H I J k
l M n O p
q R S T u
v w x y z

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
t b

Output:
A b C d e
F G H i j
k l m n o
p q r s u
v w x y z

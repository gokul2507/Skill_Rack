Sorting Rectangles

The program must accept the length L and breadth B of N rectangles as the input. The program must find the area of each rectangle. Then 
the program must sort the N rectangles in descending order based on the area. If two or more rectangles have the same area, then the 
program must sort N rectangles in descending order based on the breadth. Finally, the program must print the length, breadth and area 
of the N sorted rectangles as the output.

Your task to define the class Rectangle so that the program runs successfully.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains the length and the breadth of a rectangle.

Output Format:
The first N lines contain the length, breadth and area of the N rectangles after sorting.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
3 6
4 3
6 8
3 4
5 7

Output:
6 8 48
5 7 35
3 6 18
3 4 12
4 3 12

Explanation:
The area of the 1st rectangle is 18 (3*6).
The area of the 2nd rectangle is 12 (4*3).
The area of the 3rd rectangle is 48 (6*8).
The area of the 4th rectangle is 12 (3*4).
The area of the 5th rectangle is 35 (5*7).
After sorting the rectangles based on the given conditions, the rectangles become
6 8 48
5 7 35
3 6 18
3 4 12
4 3 12

Input:
7
15 15
40 10
20 20

20 20 400
40 10 400
6 40 240
30 8 240
15 15 225

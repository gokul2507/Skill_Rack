Max Rectangular Area
The program must accept the length L and breadth B of a land as the input. The L*B land is divided into smaller areas using the H 
horizontal cuts and V vertical cuts. The program accepts H integers representing the distances at which the horizontal cuts present on 
the land from the top. Similarly, the program accepts V integers representing the distances at which the vertical cuts present on the 
land from the left. The program must print the area of the largest rectanglular land after dividing the L*B land based on the given 
horizontal cuts and vertical cuts.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= L, B <= 1000
1 <= H, V <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains L and B separated by a space.
The second line contains H.
The third line contains H integer values separated by a space.
The fourth line contains V.
The fifth line contains V integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the area of the largest rectanglular land after dividing the given L*B land.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 15
3
3 7 9
2
5 11

Output:
24

Explanation:
Here L = 10, B = 15, H = 3 and V = 2.
After dividing the 10*15 land based on the 3 horizontal cuts and 2 vertical cuts, the land becomes

The hash symbol (#) represents the land.
The pipe symbol (|) represents the vertical cut.
The hyphen symbol (-) represents the horizontal cut.
The plus symbol (+) represents the intersection of the vertical cut and horizontal cut.

Water Buckets in Staircase
There are N buckets arranged in a staircase (i.e., one bucket in each step, 1st bucket in the 1st step, 2nd bucket in the 2nd step, 
3rd bucket in the 3rd step, and so on). The N steps are increasing from left to right. The amount of water(in litres) in each bucket 
is passed as the input. All buckets have the same size and the same capacity. A hole is drilled in each bucket so that each bucket 
can hold only X litres of water. If water leaks from the hole of a bucket, then the water will flow into the bucket at its bottom 
in the staircase. If the water leaks from the 1st bucket, then the water will flow into the ground. The program must print the amount 
of water in each bucket when the water in all N buckets is stable(i.e., the state when there is no leakage in N buckets).

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Amount of water in each bucket, X <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the amount of water in each bucket separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
6 10 15 10 13
11

Output:
10 11 11 11 11

Explanation:
Here N = 5 and X = 11.
After drilling the holes, each bucket can hold 11 litres of water.
5th bucket: 2 litres leaked.
4th bucket: 2 litres added & 1 litre leaked.
3rd bucket: 1 litre added & 5 litres leaked.
2nd bucket: 5 litres added & 4 litres leaked.
1st bucket: 4 litres added.
Finally, the amount of water in the 5 buckets are 10 11 11 11 11.

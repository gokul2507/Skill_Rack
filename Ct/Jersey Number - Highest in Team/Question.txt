Jersey Number - Highest in Team (Id-3142)

In a school there are N students standing in a straight line.  Their Jersey numbers from left to right are passed as the input. The 
students are to be divided into teams of size T starting from left. First T students form Team 1, next T students form Team 2 and 
so on. If N is not divisible by T and say the remainder is R, the R students are distributed among the teams formed so far in a round 
robin fashion (starting from the first team) until the R students are assigned to one of the teams.
Once the teams are formed, the program must print the highest jersey number in each team.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains the jersey numbers of N students separated by a space.
The third line contains T.

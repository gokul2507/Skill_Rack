Sort Numbers By Unit and Tenth Digits (Id-3175)

Given N positive integers, the program must sort the numbers based on their unit digits (Smaller to larger). If the unit digits are 
same, then consider tenth digit to sort. Assume no two numbers will have both unit and tenth digits equal.

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sorted integers separated by a space.

Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 100

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:

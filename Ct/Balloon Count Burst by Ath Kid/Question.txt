Balloon Count Burst by Ath Kid (Id-3178)

There are N filled balloons each painted with a random number B(i) where i is from 1 to N and the balloons are tied up to a rope in a 
straight line. M kids who play football arrive and they decide to burst the balloons with the numbers divisible by their jersey numbers 
J(a) where a is from 1 to M. The program must print the count C of the balloons burst by the Ath kid (1 <= A <= M).

Input Format:
The first line contains N, M, A each separated by a space.
The second line contains N positive integers which denote the numbers on the balloons separated by a space.
The third line contains M positive integers which denote the numbers on the jerseys separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains C

Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 9999
1 <= M <= 20
1 <= A <= M

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12 3 2
38 40 11 46 44 48 35 14 39 44 23 45
2 3 11

Output:
2

Explanation:
Here A = 2. So we need to print the balloons burst by the 2nd kid.
The 1st kid bursts balloons with numbers which are divisible by 2. So the balloons remaining are 11 35 39 23 45
The 2nd kid bursts balloons with numbers which are divisible by 3. So the balloons he/she bursts are with numbers 39 and 45 and hence 
answer is 2.

Binary Growing Sequence or Not
The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print "YES" if the given N integers represent a binary growing 
sequence. Else the program must print "NO" as the output. A binary growing sequence is a sequence of positive integers (B1, B2, B3, 
... Bn), where all ones in the binary representation of Bi are in the places of ones in the binary representation of B(i + 1).

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
1 5 7 23

Output:
YES

Explanation:
The binary representation of 1 is 1.
The binary representation of 5 is 101.
The binary representation of 7 is 111.
The binary representation of 23 is 10111.
The binary growing sequence is 1, 101, 111 and 10111.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
2 10 27 219 731

Output:
YES

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
4 12 57 185

Output:
NO

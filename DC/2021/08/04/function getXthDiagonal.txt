function getXthDiagonal
The function/method getXthDiagonal accepts four arguments R, C, matrix and X. The integers R and C represent the size of the integer 
matrix. The integer X represents the position of a top-left to bottom-right diagonal.

The function/method getXthDiagonal must return an integer array containing the integers in the Xth top-left to bottom-right diagonal 
of the given matrix. The top-left to bottom-right diagonals are numbered from the bottom-left cell of the matrix.

Your task is to implement the function getXthDiagonal so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition 
again in your code).

typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    int *arr;
} boundedArray;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= X <= R+C-1

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 5
89 56 81 32 15
48 30 71 23 94
39 28 18 75 14
19 33 57 91 95
93 70 80 59 60
32 73 36 69 83
7

Output:
Diagonal 7: 56 71 75 95

Explanation:
Here X = 7.
The 7th top-left to bottom-right diagonal in the given matrix is highlighted below.
89 56 81 32 15
48 30 71 23 94
39 28 18 75 14
19 33 57 91 95
93 70 80 59 60
32 73 36 69 83
So the integers in the diagonal are printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 8
20 38 79 55 99 62 81 88
59 30 65 45 15 36 89 27
14 90 38 59 91 91 93 11
12 83 37 47 18 11 95 72
77 80 30 49 62 74 66 32
3

Output:
Diagonal 3: 14 83 30

Ascending Descending Array
Two arrays with size M and N are passed as the input. One of the arrays is sorted in ascending order and the other array is sorted in 
descending order. The program must print the array sorted in ascending order and then the program must print the array sorted in 
descending order. 

If in both arrays all the elements are equal 
- then print the array with the smaller value first.
- if the values are also same then print the first array followed by the second array.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= M, N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains M.
The second line contains M integers separated by a space.
The third line contains N.
The fourth line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first two lines contain the integer values based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 
10 10 9 5
5
10 10 15 25 80

Output:
10 10 15 25 80
10 10 9 5

Explanation:
The first array is sorted in descending order.
The second array is sorted in ascending order.
So the second array is printed first and then the first array is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
15 15 15 15 15
4
10 10 10 10

Output:
10 10 10 10
15 15 15 15 15

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
5
15 15 15 15 15
4
15 15 15 15

Output:
15 15 15 15 15
15 15 15 15

Example Input/Output 4:
Input:
4
15 15 15 15
5
15 15 15 15 15

Output:
15 15 15 15
15 15 15 15 15

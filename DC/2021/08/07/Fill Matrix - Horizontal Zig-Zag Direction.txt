Fill Matrix - Horizontal Zig-Zag Direction
The program must accept N integers and two integers R, C as the input. The program must form an integer matrix of size R*C based on the following conditions.
- Initially, the matrix must be filled with zeroes.
- Then the program must fill the matrix with the given integers in horizontal zig-zag direction starting from the bottom-right cell. If N is greater than R*C, then the program must refill the matrix in horizontal zig-zag direction starting from the bottom-right cell till all the given integers are used.
Finally, the program must print the integer matrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.7
The third line contains R and C separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
11
10 20 30 40 11 22 33 44 50 60 70
3 3

Output:
50 44 33
40 11 22
30 70 60

Explanation:
Here N = 10, R = 3 and C = 3.
The size of the integer matrix is 3*3.
After filling the matrix based on the given conditions, the matrix becomes
50 44 33
40 11 22
30 70 60

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
25
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
4 3

Output:
22 23 24
21 20 19
16 17 18
15 14 25

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
12
1 2 3 4 10 20 30 40 11 22 33 44
2 2

Output:
33 44
22 11

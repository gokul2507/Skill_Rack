The function/method sortAndSplitWords accepts two arguments file1name and file2name representing the names of two text files. Each file 
contains a list of words.

The function/method sortAndSplitWords must read all the words from the given two files. Then the function must sort the words. Finally, 
the function must write the first half of the words in the first file and the second half of the words in the second file.

- The maximum length of each word in the two files is 50.
- The total number of words in the two files is always even.

V and Inverted V - Combined Pattern
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the characters in the string S based on the following conditions.
- The characters in the string S must be printed in V-shape and inverted V-shape in (L+1)/2 lines as shown in the Example Input/Output 
section, where L is the length of the string.
- The asterisks must be printed instead of the empty spaces in the pattern.
Note: The length of S is always odd.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of S <= 99

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first (L+1)/2 lines contain the combined pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack

Output:
s***l***k
*k*l*r*c*
**i***a**
*k*l*r*c*
s***l***k

Explanation:
Here the string S = skillrack.
The V pattern of the string is given below.
s*******k
*k*****c*
**i***a**
***l*r***
****l****
The inverted V pattern of the string is given below.
****l****
***l*r***
**i***a**
*k*****c*
s*******k
The combined pattern(V and Inverted V) is given below.
s***l***k
*k*l*r*c*
**i***a**
*k*l*r*c*
s***l***k

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
ABCDEFGHIJK

Output:
A****F****K
*B**E*G**J*
**CD***HI**
**CD***HI**
*B**E*G**J*
A****F****K

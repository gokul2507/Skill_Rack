Sort Cities by Population
The program must accept the names of N cities as the input. The number of men and women in each city are also passed as the input. The 
program must sort the cities in descending order based on the total population. If two or more cities have the same population, then 
the program must sort those cities in descending order based on the number of men. If two or more cities have the same population and 
the same number of men, then the program must sort those cities based on their names.

Your task is to define the class City so that the program runs successfully.

function findTotalMarks
The function/method findTotalMarks accepts two arguments file1name and file2name representing the names of two text files. The first 
file contains a list of student names. The second file contains the marks in three subjects of the students.

The function/method findTotalMarks must find the total marks of each student and then modify the content of the first file by adding 
the total marks after the name of each student.

Your task is to implement the function findTotalMarks so that it passes all the test cases.

Note:
- Both the files have the same number of lines.
- The length of each student's name must be less than or equal 30.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

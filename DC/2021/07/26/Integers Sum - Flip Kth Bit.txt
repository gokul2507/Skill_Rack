Integers Sum - Flip Kth Bit
The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. For each integer X among the given N integers, the program must flip 
the Kth bit from the end of the binary representation of X. If the number of bits in the binary representation of X is less than K, 
then the program must not modify the integer X. Finally, the program must print the sum of the N revised integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 15

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the N revised integers.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
10 31 3 16
3

Output:
64

Explanation:
The binary representation of 10 is 1010.
After flipping the 3rd bit from the end, the 1st integer becomes 14 (1110).
The binary representation of 31 is 11111.
After flipping the 3rd bit from the end, the 2nd integer becomes 27 (11011).
The binary representation of 3 is 11.
The number of bits in the binary representation of 3 is 2, which is less than 3. So the 3rd integer remains the same.
The binary representation of 16 is 10000.
After flipping the 3rd bit from the end, the 4th integer becomes 20 (10100).
So their sum is 64 (14 + 27 + 3 + 20).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
1 4 17 11 14 5 20 8
4

Output:
72

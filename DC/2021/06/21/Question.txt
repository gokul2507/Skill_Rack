Bank Transactions - Exception Handling
The program must accept N transactions of a bank account as the input. Each transaction has a character (+ for credit or - for debit) 
followed by the amount. The initial balance of the bank account is Rs. 1000. For each transaction, the program must validate the 
transaction and perform the transaction based on the following conditions.
- If the amount to be credited is greater than 10000, then the program must print "Max credit limit exceeded". Else the given amount 
must be credited to the bank account and the updated balance must be printed.
- If the amount to be debited is greater than the account balance, then the program must print "Insufficient balance". Else the given 
amount must be debited from the bank account and the updated balance must be printed.

Your task is to fill in the missing lines of code so that the program runs successfully.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
+ 500
- 2000
+ 2000
+ 14000
- 1000

Output:
1500
Insufficient balance
3500
Max credit limit exceeded
2500

Explanation:
The initial account balance is 1000.
1st transaction: credit 500. The updated balance is 1500.
2nd transaction: debit 2000. 2000 > 1500, so "Insufficient balance" is printed.
3rd transaction: credit 2000. The updated balance is 3500.
4th transaction: credit 14000. 14000 > 10000, so "Max credit limit exceeded" is printed.
5th transaction: debit 1000. The updated balance is 2500.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
- 1000
+ 10000
- 10001
+ 10001

Output:

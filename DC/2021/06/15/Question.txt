Merge Columns Fold to the Right
An integer matrix with R rows and C columns is passed as the input. The programs must fold the matrix towards the right starting from 
Nth column and merge(add the cell values) the overlapping column values. Then the program must print the resulting matrix.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 10^4
1 <= N <= C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains N.

Output Format:
The first R lines containing the folded matrix based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 2
10 20 30 40 50
4

Output:
9 3 2 1
10 6 4 2
90 30 20 10

Explanation:
The matrix must be folded from the fourth column towards the right. So the 4th column will merge with the 5th column.
So the 1st column values are 4+5=9, 8+2=10 and 40+50=90.
The 2nd column values are 3, 6 and 30.
The 3rd column values are 2, 4 and 20.
The 4th column values are 1, 2 and 10.
Hence the output is
9 3 2 1
10 6 4 2
90 30 20 10

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 5
1 2 3 4 5
4 8 6 7 9
10 20 30 45 55
2

Output:
5 5 5
14 11 9
50 55 55

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
3 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 2
10 20 30 40 50
5

Output:
5 4 3 2 1
2 8 6 4 2
50 40 30 20 10

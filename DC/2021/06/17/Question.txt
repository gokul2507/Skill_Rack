Define class BasicCalculator
The class Hello.java accepts two integers X and Y as the input. The class Hello.java must perform the six basic arithmetic operations 
(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Integer Division, Float Division and Modulo) on the given two integers and print their results 
as the output.

The class Hello.java is given below.

import java.util.Scanner;
import com.skillrack.BasicCalculator;

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int Y = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(BasicCalculator.addition(X, Y));
        System.out.println(BasicCalculator.subtraction(X, Y));
        System.out.println(BasicCalculator.multiplication(X, Y));
        System.out.println(BasicCalculator.integerDivision(X, Y));
        System.out.printf("%.3f\n", BasicCalculator.floatDivision(X, Y));
        System.out.println(BasicCalculator.modulo(X, Y));
    }
}

Your task is to define the class BasicCalculator in the package com.skillrack so that the program runs successfully.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
20 8

Output:
28
12
160
2
2.500
4

Explanation:
20 + 8 = 28
20 - 8 = 12
20 * 8 = 160
20 / 8 = 2 (Integer division)
20 / 8 = 2.5 (Float division)
20 % 8 = 4

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7 9

Output:
16
-2
63
0
0.778
7

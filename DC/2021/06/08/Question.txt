Swap Every Two Vowels
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must swap every two vowels in the string S. Then the program must print 
the revised string S as the output. If the number of vowels is odd, then the last vowel will remain the same as there is no pair 
to swap.

Note: The string S always contains at least two vowels.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
environment

Output:
inverenmont

Explanation:
There are four vowels in the given string "environment".
After swapping the vowels e and i, the string environment becomes inveronment.
After swapping the vowels o and e, the string inveronment becomes inverenmont.
Hence the output is inverenmont.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
TOUCHPAD

Output:
TUOCHPAD

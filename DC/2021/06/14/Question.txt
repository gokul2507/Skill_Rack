function getRectangleArea
The function/method getRectangleArea accepts two arguments - point1 and point2 representing two opposite vertices of a rectangle. Any 
two sides of the rectangle are always parallel to X-axis.

The function/method getRectangleArea must return an integer representing the area of the given rectangle.

Your task is to implement the function getRectangleArea so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent Point and is already defined in the default code (Do not write these definition again in 
your code).
typedef struct point
{
    int X;
    int Y;
} Point;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1 1
4 3

Output:
6

Explanation:
The point (1, 1) indicates the bottom-left corner of the rectangle.
The point (4, 3) indicates the top-right corner of the rectangle.
The length of the rectangle is 3.
The breadth of the rectangle is 2.
So the area of the rectangle is 6 (3*2).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
2 -3
-5 1

Output:
28

Explanation:
The point (2, -3) indicates the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.
The point (-5, 1) indicates the top-left corner of the rectangle.
The length of the rectangle is 7.
The breadth of the rectangle is 4.
So the area of the rectangle is 28 (7*4).

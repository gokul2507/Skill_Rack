Maximum Number of Balls - Triangle
In a game, there are (N*(N+1))/2 boxes arranged as a triangle based on the following conditions.
- N boxes in the Nth row.
- N-1 boxes in the (N-1)th row.
- N-2 boxes in the (N-2)th row.
- N-3 boxes in the (N-3)th row.
- Similarly, the remaining boxes are arranged as a triangle.
Each box contains a certain number of balls. The number of balls in each box is passed as the input. The program must print the maximum 
number of balls that can be collected from the boxes based on the following condition.
- The only box in the 1st row must be picked. For the remaining rows, one of the two adjacent boxes in the next row to the previously 
selected box must be picked.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 100
1 <= Number of balls in each box <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines containing the triangle, where the asterisks in each row represent the empty spaces.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the maximum number of balls that can be collected from the boxes.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
***3
**4 2
*7 6 9

Define class Rectangle
The program must accept the length, the breadth of N rectangles and an integer X as the input. The program must print the number of 
rectangles and the total area of the N rectangles. Then the program must remove the Xth rectangle from the N rectangles. Then the 
program must print the length, the breadth and the area of N-1 rectangles as shown in the Example Input/Output section. Finally, 
the program must print the number of rectangles remaining and the total area of the remaining rectangles as the output.

Your task is to define the class Rectangle so that the program runs successfully.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 50
1 <= X <= N

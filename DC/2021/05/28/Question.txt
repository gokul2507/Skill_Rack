Matrix - Remove Apples & Oranges
The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C containing only A's and O's as the input. The character A represents an apple. 
The character O represents an orange. The program must remove the fruits in the matrix based on the following conditions.
- Only the fruits in the last row of the matrix are allowed to be removed.
- If the number of apples is greater than or equal to the number of oranges in the last row, then the program must remove the apples 
from the last row. Else the program must remove the oranges from the last row.
- Once a fruit is removed, the fruits above the empty space will move down by one position.
The program must print the matrix after removing the fruits T times as the output. The value of T is also passed as the input to the 
program. The empty spaces must be printed as asterisks.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= T <= R

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)nd line contains T.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.

Explanation:
T = 1 (4 apples and 2 oranges in the last row). After removing the apples, the matrix becomes
A * * * O *
O O O A A O
A A O A A A
O A O A A O
O A O O O O
T = 2 (1 apple and 5 oranges in the last row). After removing the oranges, the matrix becomes
* * * * * *
A O * * O *
O A O A A O
A A O A A A
O A O A A O
T = 3 (3 apples and 3 oranges in the last row). After removing the apples, the matrix becomes
* * * * * *
A * * * * *
O O O * O O
A A O A A A
O A O A A O

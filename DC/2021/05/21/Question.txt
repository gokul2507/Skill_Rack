Toggle Format - List of Integers
The program must accept a list of integers as the input. The program must print the output based on the following conditions.
- If the given list of integers present horizontally, then the program must print the list of integers vertically in reverse order.
- If the given list of integers present vertically, then the program must print the list of integers horizontally in reverse order.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Number of integers in the list <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains a list of integers separated by a space. (or) The lines, each contains an integer.

Output Format:
The first line contains a list of integers separated by a space. (or) The lines, each contains an integer.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 20 30 40 50

Output:
50
40
30
20
10

Explanation:
Here the given list of integers present horizontally as 10 20 30 40 50.
So the list of integers are printed vertically in reverse order.
Hence the output is
50
40
30
20
10

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
100
200
300
400
500
600

Output:
600 500 400 300 200 100

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs

Find Time - Analog Clock

The program must accept a matrix of size 5*5 representing a 12-hour analog clock where the 12 numbers are misplaced. The program also 
accepts two integers N1 and N2, where N1 represents the number pointed by the hour handle in the given clock and N2 represents the number 
pointed by the minute handle in the given clock. The program must find the original time for the given values N1, N2 and print the 
original time in the format HH:MM as the output.
The 5*5 matrix representation of the original clock is given below. The asterisks in the clock represent the empty spaces.
* 11 12 1 *
10 * * * 2
9 * * * 3
8 * * * 4
* 7 6 5 *

Input Format:
The first 5 lines containing the matrix.
The 6th line contains N1 and N2 separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the original time in the format HH:MM.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
* 8 9 11 *
3 * * * 5
6 * * * 7
4 * * * 1
* 2 12 10 *
8 10

Output:
11:25

Explanation:
The number pointed by the hour handle is 8 and the number pointed by the minute handle is 10.
In the original clock, the values of HH and MM are given below.
HH = 11
MM = 25
So 11:25 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
* 4 9 1 *
12 * * * 6
7 * * * 5
8 * * * 10
* 3 2 11 *
6 7

Output:
02:45

Minimum Length - String Values
The program must accept N string values as the input. The program must print the output based on the following conditions.
- The program must find the length L of the shortest string in the list of string values.
- The program must print the first L characters of each string. Then the program must remove the first L characters in each string. If 
all the characters in a string are removed, then the program must remove that string from the list.
- The program must repeat the above processes till all the characters in the given N string values are printed.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 50
1 <= Length of each string <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value.

Output Format:
The lines, each contains a string value.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
lion
kingdom
monday
car

Output:
lio
kin
mon
car
n
g
d
do
ay
m

Explanation:
Here N = 4.
The length of the shortest string is 3. So the first 3 characters of each string are printed.
lio
kin
mon
car

After removing the first 3 characters, only 3 string values are in the list.
n
gdom
day

The length of the shortest string is 1. So the first character of each string is printed.
n
g
d

After removing the first character, only 2 string values are in the list.
dom
ay

The length of the shortest string is 2. So the first 2 characters of each string are printed.
do
ay

After removing the first 2 characters, only 1 string value is in the list and it is printed as the output.
m

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:

Output:
not

Define Class Student
The program must accept the name and the marks of N students as the input. Each student gets extra marks (0 to 10) based on his or her 
attendance percentage. The additional marks awarded to the N students are also passed as the input to the program. For each student, 
the program must add the additional marks to his or her marks so that the total marks do not exceed 100. Finally, the program must 
print the name and the revised marks of the N students as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Your task is to define the class Student so that the program runs successfully.

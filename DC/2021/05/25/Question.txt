Binary Prefix Count - Divisible by X
The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must find the binary representation B of the integer N. Then the 
program print the number of prefixes in B whose decimal equivalents are divisible by X as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= X <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of prefixes in B whose decimal equivalents are divisible by X.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
52 2

Output:
3

Explanation:
The binary representation of 52 is B = 110100.
All prefixes in B and the corresponding decimal equivalents are given below.
110100 -> 52
11010 -> 26
1101 -> 13
110 -> 6
11 -> 3
1 -> 1
Here 52, 26 and 6 are divisible by 2. So the count 3 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
147 3

Output:
4

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
98 6

Output:
3

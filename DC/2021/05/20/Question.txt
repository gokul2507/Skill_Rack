function getArrayFromMatrix
The function/method getArrayFromMatrix accepts three arguments - R, C and matrix. The integer R represents the number of rows in the 
matrix, the integer C represents the number of columns in the matrix and a two dimensional array of integers matrix.

The function/method getArrayFromMatrix must return an array of integers containing all the integers in the given matrix in the reverse 
order of their occurrence (i.e., the traversal starting from the last row of the matrix and moving from right to left in each row).

Your task is to implement the function getArrayFromMatrix so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition 
again in your code).
typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    int *arr;
} boundedArray;
IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 5
10 20 30 40 50
55 65 75 85 95
66 77 88 99 11

Output:
Matrix:
10 20 30 40 50
55 65 75 85 95
66 77 88 99 11
Array: 11 99 88 77 66 95 85 75 65 55 50 40 30 20 10

Explanation:
The integers in the 3rd row (right to left) are 11 99 88 77 66.
The integers in the 2nd row (right to left) are 95 85 75 65 55.
The integers in the 1st row (right to left) are 50 40 30 20 10.
So the array contains the following 15 (3*5) integers.
11 99 88 77 66 95 85 75 65 55 50 40 30 20 10

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 2
10 45
50 60
78 68

Output:
Matrix:
10 45
50 60
78 68
Array: 68 78 60 50 45 10
